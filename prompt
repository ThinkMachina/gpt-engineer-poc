We are creating an API that manages a basic to-do list, including adding, editing, marking as complete, and deleting tasks. We must be able to view the list through a GET method. 

To add or edit, you need to specify a name, that will be the key for the task. You can edit the name, the description and due date. The due date is formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. Tasks completed are marked as done. To delete a task, provide the id. When you do a get, also print the id of the task. The id should be an integer. You should support filtering and sorting.
